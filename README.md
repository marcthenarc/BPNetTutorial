A Network Game Tutorial for Unreal 4 in Blueprint

This is my code based on Billy Bramer's Blueprint Network Tutorial.

This code won't be updated in the near future - unless some weird typo creeped in somehow - because I want to use it as a
"clean slate" for implementing features in other projects.

Read COPYING.txt for my extremely permissive and delicious licence.
